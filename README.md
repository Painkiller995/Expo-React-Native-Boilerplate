# Expo React Native  Boilerplate - TypeScript

## Features 🛠️

- [**Expo V50**](https://expo.dev/): The fastest way to build native apps for iOS, Android, and the web using JavaScript and React.
- **Tailwind**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

### Tools 🛠️

- [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/): Statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/): An opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
- [**VSCode**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode): Configuration file and recommended extensions.

```bash
